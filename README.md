CoffeeShop Mapper is a web application built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the Leaflet library for mapping. The main idea behind this application is to allow users to mark coffee shop locations on a map and record additional information about each coffee shop.

## Features

- Interactive Map: Users can click on the map to select the location of a coffee shop.
- Information Form: A form pops up when a location is selected, allowing users to input details such as price score, seat score, availability of sockets, quality of toilets, coffee quality, etc.
- Record Coffee Shops: By submitting the form (using the keyboard's Enter key), a new box is added to a row under the map, displaying the coffee shop's information.
- Map Navigation: Clicking on a box in the row will move the map to the corresponding coffee shop's location.
- Temporary Storage: The application utilizes localStorage to store the data temporarily, allowing users to revisit and view their recorded coffee shops even after closing the browser.

## Installation and Usage

- Clone the repository or download the project files.
- Open the index.html file in a web browser.
- Use the mouse to click on the map to select a coffee shop location.
- Fill out the form that appears, providing relevant details about the coffee shop.
- Press the Enter key to submit the form and add a new box to the row under the map.
- Click on a box to navigate the map to the corresponding coffee shop's location.
- Enjoy recording and exploring coffee shops!
